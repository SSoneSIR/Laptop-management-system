The Python script for the laptop shop system facilitates a straightforward management process for buying and selling laptops. It begins by loading laptop data from laptop_Data.txt into a dictionary and displays current stock from laptops.txt. Users are presented with options to either buy laptops from manufacturers, which involves updating stock and generating invoices, or sell to customers, where stock is reduced and invoices are created, including optional shipping costs. The script ensures that transactions are recorded and saved with detailed invoices named after the user's information. Proper formatting of input files is essential, and the script assumes valid user inputs throughout the process.
